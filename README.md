# Movie budget Project.

**Author**: Abdikarim Gedi Mohamed

## Overview



* As part of my work with Microsoft's new movie studio, I was tasked with exploring the current landscape of the movie industry to determine what types of films are performing the best at the box office. To achieve this, I gathered data on movie budgets and analyzed this data using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

* My analysis has shown that there is a strong correlation between production budget and worldwide gross. Specifically, movies with larger budgets tend to perform better at the box office than those with smaller budgets. Based on this finding, I recommend that Microsoft allocate between 50 million to 150 million dollars to produce a movie in order to maximize its chances of success at the box office.

## Business Problem.

I have been informed that Microsoft wants a piece of the multi-billion dollar movie-making industry, but that they are unsure of where to begin. The challenge for their new movie studio is that they are ready to jump into the industry but do not have the necessary knowledge to move forward. To assist them with this goal, I have been looking at the movies that performed highest in worldwide box office . By analyzing the movies that have been most successful recently, I can make recommendations about attributes that Microsoft's movies should have in order to achieve the highest revenue. I have based my analysis on four main factors:

* Movie Type: What types of movie content are currently most successful?
* Release Month: When is the most lucrative time of year to release a movie?
* Production Budget: What budget amount tends to achieve the highest box office gross?
* Additional Attributes: Based on these findings, what else do top-grossing movies have in common?

## Data


* In order to gain insights into the movie industry and provide recommendations to Microsoft's new movie studio executives, I have taken several important steps. Firstly, I  have acquired and cleaned one movie budget dataset which contains information about movies' box office gross, and the movie budgets. This process of data cleaning involves identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing data in order to ensure that the data is accurate and reliable.


* Now that I have the merged dataset, I  began to analyze the data using statistical techniques and visualizations. By exploring the data in this way, I  could identify patterns and relationships that may exist between different variables, such as the movie names, release month, budget, and box office gross. This analysis  helped me  draw conclusions about the industry and provide recommendations to Microsoft's new movie studio executives about how to maximize their chances of success.


* Overall, the process of acquiring, cleaning, merging, and analyzing datasets is critical to gaining insights into complex industries like the movie industry. By taking these steps, I could make informed decisions and provide valuable recommendations to key Microsoft.


## Methods

* I removed unnecessary data such as duplicates and irrelevant columns. I filled null values. I utilized descriptive statistics as well as visualizations to illuminate trends in the data and isolate key factors for making a successful movie. This approach was appropriate for analyzing trends in the movie industry and common attributes of high-grossing movies, so that I could make informed recommendations.

# Conclusion

* Box office data analysis provides valuable insights into trends and potential investment opportunities in the entertainment industry. Through my analysis, I identified that movies with higher production budgets tend to have higher box office earnings, and movies released during the summer tend to perform better than those released in other seasons. 
I also identified top-performing movies based on box office earnings. Furthermore, I predicted the potential box office success of future movies based on past trends. These insights can help Microsoft identify potential investment opportunities in the entertainment industry.

* In conclusion, I strongly recommend that Microsoft invest in a new studio to produce high-budget action, science fiction, and adventure movies. This move will allow Microsoft to leverage its technology and resources, tap into a growing market, and attract top talent in the film industry. By doing so, Microsoft can achieve significant growth and performance in the box office space and establish itself as a major player in the entertainment industry.
